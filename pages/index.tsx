          About me
        </h6>
        <h5>
          I am a self-thought developer. I started my interest in programming
          since highscool creating simple html pages. In college I pursue an
          Engineering course and put away my coding interests.
        </h5>
        <br />
        <h5>
          Way back 2019 I started to get back at coding as a hobby and slowly
          got back on track. Now I learned so much thing specially in web
          development and I can now build a complete apps from scratch from
          ecommerce sites, premium business sites, realtime-chat apps with video
          calling, deploying servers and hosting webapps online.
        </h5>
        <br />
        <h5>
          I want to extend my interests in programming by landing a job in this
          industry and hoping to find a team that would really make me a good
          fit for them because I believe that I can be the best version of me
          when doing this thing that I love.
